# Introduction:

This codebase provides resources for the development of accurate machine learning models for personalized treatment of patients with psychotic and mood disorders. The goal of the study is to extract trauma-related features from electronic health records (EHRs) of psychiatric patients. The study makes several contributions including the creation of training and testing corpora of EHRs, development of an annotation scheme, establishment of a gold standard corpus, and development of an annotation guideline. The study utilizes natural language processing (NLP) tools and the Brat rapid annotation interface, an open-source NLP annotation tool, to extract trauma-related information from clinical text. The study is the first attempt to identify trauma-related features in patients with psychotic and mood disorders.

The resources developed in this study are intended for use by the psychiatric community to improve the accuracy of machine learning models for the treatment of psychotic and mood disorders.
